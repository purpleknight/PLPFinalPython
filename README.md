# 📊 COVID-19 Global Data Tracker
## 📝 Project Description
The COVID-19 Global Data Tracker is a comprehensive data analysis and visualization project designed to track global COVID-19 trends. It analyzes cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across multiple countries and time periods. The project incorporates real-world datasets and performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and statistical insights using Python.

By the end of the project, users will have a fully structured Jupyter Notebook containing a well-documented analysis, suitable for research and presentation.

## 🚩 Project Objectives
✅ Import & clean COVID-19 datasets<br> ✅ Analyze trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations<br> ✅ Compare COVID-19 metrics across multiple countries<br>✅ Visualize trends using charts, heatmaps, and world maps<br> ✅ Communicate insights through structured reporting

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used
This project is powered by Python and its scientific computing stack:

pandas – Data manipulation & analysis

numpy – Numerical computations

matplotlib – Basic visualization tools

seaborn – Advanced visualizations & styling

plotly express – Interactive choropleth mapping

geopandas – Geospatial analysis (alternative for map rendering)
